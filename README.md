# Language Translator : English â†” German

# Project Overview

With the rise of globalization, the demand for seamless and effective multilingual communication is higher than ever. This project presents a Language Translator Application built in Java, designed to translate text between English and German. It demonstrates core Java development principles including GUI design, database connectivity, and exception handling, while offering a secure user authentication system and a user-friendly experience.

# Objectives

- Enable real-time text translation between English and German.
- Demonstrate practical use of Java Standard Library and JDBC.
- Connect to a MySQL database to manage translation data.
- Provide user authentication features (Sign Up & Login).
- Implement a customizable translation interface for adding, editing, or deleting entries.
- Build an intuitive GUI using Java Swing for easy interaction.
